# Astro Feline üöÄüê±

Excited to announce my latest project: **Astro Feline**, a top-down shooter game developed in Unity 2D!

**Astro Feline** combines cutting-edge technologies and creative design to deliver an engaging gaming experience. Here are some of the key technologies and tools utilized in this project:

- **C#** for scripting, game logic, and object-oriented programming
- **Leonard.ai** for AI-generated character design
- **Suno.ai** for dynamic soundscapes
- **Optimizer.ai** for sound effects
- **Photoshop** for stunning visual assets
- **Audacity** for immersive audio effects
- **Unity Animator** for smooth animations
- **State Machine** within Unity Animator for dynamic transitions and communication between different object states
- **Unity Rigidbody2D** for realistic physics
- **Unity BoxCollider2D** for precise collision detection

This entire project was built from the ground up, and it was a fun experience. One of the most interesting aspects was leveraging the State Machine in Unity Animator to ensure seamless transitions and interactions between different states of game objects, adding a layer of depth and realism to the gameplay.
